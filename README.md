Code supporting the experiments and data analysis for Large Language Model Recall Uncertainty is Modulated by the Fan Effect

## This Repo

This repo contains the code and data used to study fan effects in language models. This includes both experiments used to evaluate fan effects stemming from typicality and the recreation of Anderson's original experiment used to identify fan effects. 

## Extending this work

Others may be interested in using the methods included to generate Anderson consistent data for future work regarding fan effects in large language models.
